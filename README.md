## How to run a bot with this code
1. Create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)
2. Copy the token into a token.txt file in the root folter
3. edit the `Taskfile.yaml`, replacing -app with the application ID (in the developer portal) and -guild with the ID of the server you're using the bot in (don't include to do all servers)
